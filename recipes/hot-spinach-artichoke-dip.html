        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry — you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, garlic, basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Gently stir in artichoke hearts and spinach.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
